# KTR Dev Epock Tool ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶

## How to Use
This tool is designed to translate `ktr.csv` into `cn.csv` for the Chinese Brawl client.  
Follow these steps to use it:  

1. Place the latest `texts.csv` in the same directory as the script.  
2. Run `cn.py`.  
   - The script will add all lines from `ktr.csv` that do not already exist in the `cn.csv` file.  

## What is `del.py`?
The `del.py` script is used to delete duplicates in case something gets messed up during the process.
